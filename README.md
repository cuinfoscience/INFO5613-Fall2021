## INFO 5613: Network Science

Data involving relationships and interactions are pervasive in contemporary information society but these data require distinct methods and theories for analysis and interpretation. *Network science* is an umbrella term that encompasses interdisciplinary theories and methods for analyzing social, information, and other complex networks. Network science provides tools to develop quantitative representations linking micro-level processes to macro-level structures across diverse empirical settings like organizations, online communities, and archives. Students will develop their familiarity with the methods and theories to understand the fundamentals of networks, metrics for characterizing their structure, and the dynamics of and on networks.

### Course design
The class is split up into four modules: (1) *Fundamentals* introduces the unique vocabulary of network science and its unique data and visualizations; (2) *Structure* covers the metrics for describing networks across multiple levels of analysis; (3) *Dynamics* explores how networks can explain change in social systems; (4) *Applications* extends the network framework to more advanced methods. See the Course Outline below for more details.
